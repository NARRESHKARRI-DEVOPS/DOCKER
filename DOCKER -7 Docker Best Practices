Docker Best Practices
--------------------

1. Try to use offical images only to build your own images(custom images)

2. try to use alpine images as base images where its possible/available.

3. Don't copy/add  unnecessary files/folders which are not required,  size of image will increase.

   --> Don't install unnecessary softwares also

COPY . .

4. Try to redue the number of layers of an image as much as possible, By combining related 	commands to RUN instruction.

5. Use multi stage docker builds to reduse the size and number of layers of a image.

6. Try to run container as a non-root user.

7. Run a shell script to remove unused and dangling images on daily basis.


docker build

docker push 

docker run 

docker rmi <image_Name>

docker pull



















Docker file 1
-------------

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
NOTE: create index.html in build context






Docker file 2
--------------

FROM openjdk:11-jdk
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/maven-standalone-application*.jar maven-standalone-application.jar 
CMD ["java","-jar","maven-standalone-application.jar"]







Docker file 3 --> alpine example
-------------

FROM alpine:latest
MAINTAINER KKFUNDA <kkeducationblr@gmail.com>
LABEL author="kkfunda"
LABEL email="kkeducationblr@gmail.com"
RUN echo "welcome to kkkfunda"
COPY test.sh test.sh
WORKDIR /opt/app
RUN apt update -y
RUN apt install git wget -y
RUN mkdir -p /opt/app

ENV HOME /opt/app
RUN echo $HOME

CMD ["echo","Hello"]

--------

FROM alpine:latest
MAINTAINER KKFUNDA <kkeducationblr@gmail.com>
LABEL author="kkfunda"
LABEL email="kkeducationblr@gmail.com"
RUN echo "welcome to kkkfunda"
COPY test.sh test.sh
RUN apk update
RUN apk add git wget
CMD ["sh","test.sh"]








Docker file 4 --> Dont copy unnecessary file
----------------

FROM tomcat:8.0.21-jre8
COPY target/maven-web-application.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/maven-web-application.war
COPY . .


IQ] what is .dockerignore   file?

Ans:













Docker file 5 --> Reduse the number of layers
-------------

FROM debian:12.0
MAINTAINER KKFUNDA <kkeducationblr@gmail.com>
LABEL author="kkfunda"
LABEL email="kkeducationblr@gmail.com"
RUN echo "welcome to kkkfunda"
COPY test.sh test.sh
WORKDIR /opt/app
RUN apt update -y
RUN apt install git wget -y
RUN mkdir -p /opt/app
RUN echo "welcome to kk devops"





Docker file 6 ---> Try to run as a normal user
-------------

# Use the official Tomcat image as the base image
FROM tomcat:9.0

# Create a new user and group
RUN groupadd -r myusergroup && \
    useradd -r -m -g myusergroup -s /bin/bash kkdevops

# Change ownership of Tomcat directories to the new user
RUN chown -R myuser:myusergroup /usr/local/tomcat && \
    chmod -R 755 /usr/local/tomcat

# Switch to the new user
USER kkdevops

# Optionally, add custom configuration or application files
# COPY ./my-app.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/

# Expose the port Tomcat runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Set the default command to run Tomcat
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]

--------------

FROM test3:latest

# Switch to root user
USER root


Docker file 7  ---> Multi stage Docker file
--------------

FROM tomcat:8.5.41-jdk8
RUN apt install maven -y
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package
WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat
RUN cp /app/target/maven-web-app*.war /usr/local/tomcat/maven-web-app.war



-----------

FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-8 as aaa
WORKDIR  /app
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package

FROM tomcat:8.0.20-jre8
COPY --from=aaa /app/target/maven-web-app*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/maven-web-app.war


==============================================


once we build image and mapped with container, then after some time we need to change or add instructions in docker file ,then we rebuild image after changes in docker file, again we need to create new container and map with that image?
